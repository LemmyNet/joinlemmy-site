# New NLnet funding for Lemmy

The [NLnet foundation](https://nlnet.nl/) has previously provided three funding rounds for Lemmy, which allowed Dessalines and Nutomic to work fulltime on the project. With this funding we were able to implement fundamental features such as federation, and to get Lemmy ready for production and to prepare for the huge migration of Reddit users.

Now we have good news, a new round of funding was approved for a total of € 50.000. For the first time there will be two additional developers receiving funding: Phiresky, who has made numerous contributions to federation and database code. And Sunaurus, admin of lemm.ee who contributed many bug fixes. They will help to implement new features faster and spread the workload.

By the way, if you want to see a particular feature implemented, we always welcome contributions via pull requests. Additionally we are available for paid work on specific features. You can send a mail to `contact at join-lemmy.org`, or message `@nutomic:matrix.org` to discuss the details.
