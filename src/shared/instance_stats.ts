                "> If there's content from communities you don't want to see, then [**switch your default view type to `Subscribed`**](https://lemmynsfw.com/settings). You can also **block** the communities you don't wish to interact with **at all**. Also for finding communities combining those existing in the fediverse as well as within this instance, use [lemmyverse.net/communities](https://lemmyverse.net/communities)\n\n::: spoiler Rules\nBefore you start participating, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our rules:\n\n1. (Rule One) 🔞 **Age Requirement**: All users and lurkers MUST be age 18 or over.\n  \n-  a. Posting content involving any person who is under 18 is strictly **forbidden**. This includes real, drawn, and fictional content.\n-  b. **All loli/shota/cub** or similar content is strictly **forbidden**.\n\n2. (Rule Two)  **Respect and Consent**: Treat all members with respect and obtain consent when sharing explicit content involving others. No doxxing. No soliciting or sharing personal info. No homophobia, transphobia, body shaming, or kinkshaming. **Don’t be an asshole.**\n\n3. (Rule Three) **No NSFL/Gore/Snuff Content**: We strictly **forbid** the sharing or promotion of NSFL (Not Safe For Life) or gore content. **This includes fictional snuff scenarios.**\n\n4. (Rule Four) **No Bestiality/Zoophilia**: We strictly **forbid** any NSFW content involving animals.\n\n5. (Rule Five) **No Non-Consensual Content**: We strictly **forbid** content made or released **without consent** of everyone in the content, including revenge porn / deepfakes / leaked content / NC / true voyeur / rape content.\n\n6. (Rule Six) **No Illegal Content**: - We strictly **forbid** promotion and detailed discussion of things that are broadly illegal in most of the world, like murder, animal cruelty, money laundering, and so on. Our policy on mind-altering substances is more complicated – [see the FAQ (its in the table of contents to the right). ](https://docs.lemmynsfw.com/docs/faq/)\n  \n-  a. Solicitation of sexual services (either way, asking or offering) is strictly forbidden. [(why?)](https://docs.lemmynsfw.com/docs/policy/solictation/)\n\n7. (Rule Seven) **NSFW Flag**: All NSFW communities and posts **must be flagged** as NSFW.\n\n8. (Rule Eight) **No Rules Lawyering: Admin decisions are final and arguing with them can result in a suspension or banning of your account and removal of your content.** (if you feel a community is not being sufficiently moderated or properly following these guidelines, please contact an admin.)\n\n9. (Rule Nine) **Don't Spam Posts**: Please only post a few posts to a community at a time. You may mean well by posting several posts at once, but because of lemmy's limited algorithms this will saturate the feeds of many people on this instance and other instances. \n\n  - What is considered spamming will be left up to the admins/mods, but if you've made more than 10 posts at a time in a single community, consider waiting until a later time to continue posting to that community. \n\n - Please limit cross posting the same image to 5 times or less\n\n  - Spamming may result in a 1 day or longer community or sitewide ban depending on the severity and if it's a repeated offense.\n\nIf any material is ambiguous or borderline forbidden content, **we’re usually going to err on the side of caution.** Please use your common sense. \n\nThis is a condensed form of our rules. If you want to read further discussion into the rules above, our reasonings behind our decisions, general knowledge about the instance and things generally our team would like you to know [please click here to visit our docs page](https://docs.lemmynsfw.com/).\n\n**All users and communities must follow and respect these general instance-wide rules. Any violations could result in suspension or banning of your account or community and purging of your content.**\n\n\n:::\n\n::: spoiler Community Guidelines\n1. **Stay Relevant**: Share relevant content in the relevant communities and ensure your content complies with the rules of those communities.\n\n2. **Self-Promotion**: Self-Promotion is only okay as long as the community you are posting in allows it, and you don’t spam it.\n\n3. **Content Sourcing** - We would strongly prefer all content be credited and sourced if possible, to make it easier to keep CSAM and noncon off of the instance. [See the FAQ for more info.](https://docs.lemmynsfw.com/docs/faq/) \n\n4. **Furry Content** - Furry content is allowed (unless it conflicts with any other rules) but furries may be better served at https://pawb.social/ or https://yiffit.net/.\n:::\n\n::: spoiler Temporary Rules\nBecause of technical limitations of the Lemmy platform, we are forced to implement some restrictions on content. These are restrictions that don’t necessarily fit with our larger philosophy. **We hope to revise this section** once Lemmy evolves as a platform and moderation tools improve.\n\n1. **NSFW User Avatar**: NSFW user avatars are prohibited as it is currently not possible to mark users as NSFW. NSFW user banners are also prohibited.\n\n2. **Temporary Content Restrictions**: The following content is temporarily restricted: Hot lunch (🤮), blood, scat, CNC. \n\nIf you are the admin of another instance and you have any issues with Lemmy NSFW please raise it with one of our admins so we can communicate on how we can improve this instance. We would prefer to work with you before either of us consider defederation.\n:::\n\n___\n# Contact\n###### Mail: contact@lemmynsfw.com\n###### Mastodon: [@lemmynsfw@mastodon.world](https://mastodon.world/@lemmynsfw)\n###### Matrix public operations room (SFW only): [#lemmynsfw:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#lemmynsfw:matrix.org)\n\n___\n# [Donations](https://lemmynsfw.com/post/87160)",

The policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This policy also describes how your engagement (profile information, posts, comments, direct messages, votes) is distributed and accessed. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or organizations that SJW does not own or control, or to individuals that SJW does not employ or manage.\n\nBy joining this service you are engaging in, and contributing to, the very exciting and emerging space of free open communication on the internet. **HOWEVER YOU ARE JOINING WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS SERVICE IS RUNNING ON VERY EARLY RELEASE SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ENTIRELY EXPERIMENTAL. ALTHOUGH ALL REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA, WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE OR THIS INSTANCE CONFIGURATION IS FREE FROM DEFECT THAT MAY RESULT IN THE EXPOSURE OF ANY OR ALL SUBMITTED DATA.** \n\n**You also understand that there are controls to prevent the distribution of your email and IP address. However due to the nature of federated services, all of your *engagement* (your profile;posts;comments;messages;votes) on this platform should be considered public. We feel that proper precautions should be taken by the user regardless of what services they choose to use to engage in internet discourse, but it is highly recommended that you do not share any information on SJW, or the Lemmy platform, that could in any way personally identify you.**\n# **What information do we collect?**\n\n* **Basic account information**: If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password. You may also enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture. The username, display name, biography, profile picture are always listed publicly.\n* **Posts, comments, subscribing, voting, and other public information**:  When you post, the date and time is stored as well as the application you posted from. Posts and comments may contain media attachments, such as pictures and videos. Posts and comments are available publicly. Anything displayed on your profile is also publicly available information. Your comment history is available publicly. Your posts are delivered to the communities they are posted on, in some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. When you delete posts, this is likewise broadcast to other instances, however there is no guarantee that the removal request will be respected, or even broadcast to all instances. There are conditions that may result in copies of your profile, posts, comments, voting record not being removed or editable when requesting so from your local instance. Communities you subscribe to may be disclosed to the admins of remote instances. Although user vote records are not accessible through the UI, this should also be considered public, and there are conditions which result in it becoming publicly viewable. This service interoperates with other federated services such as Mastodon; the format, interpretation, and display of your engagement may function differently than it does on Lemmy. \n \n**In essence, your IP address and email remain private to this local instance, however due to the nature of federated services all *engagement* (your profile;posts;comments;messages;votes) should be considered public and you are responsible for taking appropriate precautions in how you engage. Do not share any sensitive or information you do not want public over Lemmy.** \n  \n* **Direct messages**: All messages are stored and processed on the instance. In some cases it means they are delivered to different instances and copies are stored there. We make a good faith effort to limit the access to these direct messages to only authorized persons, but other instances may fail to do so. Therefore it\'s important to review the instances of users you are engaging with. **Please keep in mind that the operators of the instance and any receiving instance may view such messages**, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. **Do not share any sensitive information over Lemmy.**\n* **IPs and other metadata**: When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. The latest IP address used is stored for up to 30 days. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.\n# **What do we use your information for?**\n\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n\n* To provide the core functionality of Lemmy. You can only engage with other people\'s content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may subscribe to other communities for content discovery.\n* To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.\n* The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.\n# **How do we protect your information?**\n\nWe implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. \n\nWe are disclosing that Lemmy currently does not support SSL for PostgreSQL. This instance has mitigated this security risk by running the PostgreSQL service on the same host as the instance backend, and has blocked all incoming and outgoing network connections to the PostgreSQL service. \n\nWe have additionally taken precautions to the best of our abilities to implement some other widely used industry best practices towards instance hardening and run daily encrypted remote backups.\n# **What is our data retention policy?**\n\nWe will make a good faith effort to:\n\n* Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server, in so far as such logs are kept, no more than 30 days.\n* Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users no more than 30 days.\n\nYou may irreversibly delete your account at any time. **However, this does not guarantee all instances will be notified or respect the deletion of your public data.**\n\nIn addition we retain a rolling 14 day backup policy on the entire instance.\n# **Do we use cookies?**\n\nYes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer\'s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.\n\nWe use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.\n# **Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**\n\nWe do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.

We are connected to many other sites using the activitypub protocol that you can view posts from in the "all" tab while the "local" tab shows posts on our site.\n\n---\n\n`🔗` [Site with links to all relevant programming.dev sites](https://me.programming.dev)\n\n`🟩` Not a fan of the default UI? We have alternate frontends we host that you can view the same content from\n- [Tesseract](https://t.programming.dev)\n- [Photon](https://p.programming.dev/)\n- [Alexandrite](https://a.programming.dev/)\n- [Mlmym (old reddit-like)](https://old.programming.dev/)\n- [Voyager (mobile)](https://v.programming.dev/posts/programming.dev/local)\n\n`ℹ️` We have a [wiki site](https://wiki.programming.dev) that communities can host documents on\n\n---\n\n`⚖️` All users are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://legal.programming.dev/docs/code-of-conduct/) and the other various documents on our [legal site](https://legal.programming.dev/)\n\n`❤️` The site is run by a team of volunteers. If youre interested in donating to help fund things such as server costs you can do so [here](https://github.com/sponsors/snowe2010/)\n\n`💬` We have a microblog site aimed towards programmers available at https://bytes.programming.dev\n\n`🛠️` We have a [forgejo instance](https://git.programming.dev) for hosting git repositories relating to our site and the fediverse. If you have a project that relates and follows our Code of Conduct feel free to host it there and if you have ideas for things to improve our sites feel free to create issues in the [relevant repositories](https://git.programming.dev/Programming.Dev). To go along with the instance we also have a [site for sharing small code snippets](https://blocks.programming.dev) that might be too small for their own repository.\n\n`🌲` We have a [discord server](https://discord.gg/SnUk3bKkNC) and a [matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#p.d:matrix.org) for chatting with other members of the community. These are bridged to each other (so you can interact with people using matrix from discord and vice versa.\n\n![](https://lemmy-status.org/api/v1/endpoints/_programming-dev/uptimes/7d/badge.svg) ![](https://lemmy-status.org/api/v1/endpoints/_programming-dev/response-times/7d/badge.svg)\n\n### Fediseer\n![](https://fediseer.com/api/v1/badges/endorsements/programming.dev.svg)\n\n---',

We will keep it that way unless it becomes a moderation problem.\n\n🤠 We will be around for a very long time, so you dont have to worry about us shutting down the instance anytime soon.

                "### Privacy Policy for lemdro.id (a Lemmy instance)\n\n#### Last Updated: 2023-08-11\n\n#### 1\\. Introduction\n\nWelcome to lemdro.id, a Lemmy instance. We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy, retaining only the essential data for our instance's basic functionality. Our platform is open source, and all our code can be found transparently on [Github](https://github.com/lemdro-id).\n\n#### 2\\. Information We Collect\n\n**2.1. Account Information**: When registering on our Lemmy instance, we collect your username, encrypted password, and email address. This information is used solely for account-related notifications and password recovery.\n\n**2.2. Activity Data**: We document activities such as posts and comments. Due to the federation process, these can be shared with other Lemmy instances. Therefore, consider all posts as public and avoid sharing sensitive information.\n\n**2.3. Image Hosting**: Images uploaded to our Lemmy instance are hosted by Backblaze, a third-party service.\n\n#### 3\\. How We Use Your Information\n\nWe use your data for community interactions and content sharing across the Lemmy network. Your email address is used exclusively for account alerts and password recovery.\n\n#### 4\\. Data Preservation, Retention, and User Conduct\n\nWe retain user data as long as it is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. While we strive to maintain user data's integrity, we do not guarantee its indefinite preservation. We reserve the right to purge or delete user data from our database for any reason, especially involving violations of our instance rules, codes of conduct, or other community guidelines. Users should maintain personal backups of their critical and valuable information posted on lemdro.id.\n\n**4.1. Data Storage and Backups**: Our operation involves a rolling database backup system. Therefore, user account data, activities, and hosted images on Backblaze may remain in our main database or backup database temporarily after deletion. It may take some time before their complete removal.\n\n#### 5\\. Data Protection and Third-party Processors\n\nWe have implemented safeguards to protect your data against unauthorized access, intended to meet or exceed industry standards. Our Lemmy instance is hosted on fly.io; we use Cloudflare for security and performance optimization, and Backblaze for image hosting. Processing of your data by these third-party service providers is done according to their respective privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. If additional third-party processors are engaged in the future, we will update this policy accordingly.\n\n#### 6\\. Age Requirement\n\nTo comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, EU 2016/679), users must be at least 16 years old to use lemdro.id.\n\n#### 7\\. Your Rights and Choice\n\nUnder laws such as the *General Data Protection Regulation* (GDPR) in Europe, the *Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act* (PIPEDA) in Canada, and the *California Consumer Privacy Act* (CCPA) in the United States, you have certain rights around your personal information. This includes the right to see your data, correct it if it's wrong, and in certain cases, have it completely erased. If you want to stop us from processing your data, you can do that anytime by [deleting your account](lemdro.id/settings). If you're worried about how your personal data is used, you can object to us processing your data, or you can file a complaint with the proper authority. To take advantage of your other rights or to lodge a complaint, you can reach out to us at support@lemdro.id.\n\n#### 8\\. Data Transfers\n\nGiven the nature of federation, data might be transferred to servers outside the European Economic Area (EEA). \n\n#### 9\\. DMCA Requests\n\nIf you believe that your rights under the DMCA are being infringed upon, send an email to dmca@lemdro.id detailing the following required information:\n\n- The name, address, and physical or electronic signature of the complaining party\n- Identification of the infringing materials and their internet location (e.g. a url)\n- Sufficient information to identify the copyrighted works\n- A statement by the copyright holder of a good faith belief that there is no legal basis for the use complained of\n- A statement of the accuracy of the notice and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on the behalf of the copyright holder\n\nWe will review your request within 48 hours. If it is found to be valid, the infringing content will be taken down and the DMCA request forwarded to the original poster of the content.\n\n#### 10\\. Changes to This Policy\n\nWe may revise this policy periodically. We will communicate significant changes but also recommend that you review this policy regularly.\n\n#### 11\\. Contact Us\n\nFor inquiries or concerns, please reach out at support@lemdro.id.",

When you delete or edit posts, this is likewise delivered to users in a community and your followers. The action of crossposting or upvoting another post is always public.\n- Direct messages: All posts are stored and processed on the server. In some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there.

Do not share any sensitive information over Lemmy.\n- IPs and other metadata: When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. The latest IP address used is stored for up to 12 months. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.\n\n#### What do we use your information for?\n\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n\n- To provide the core functionality of Lemmy. You can only interact with other people’s content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may follow various communities to view their combined posts in your own personalized home timeline.\n- To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.\n- The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.\n\n#### How do we protect your information?\n\nWe implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information.

We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.\n\nYour public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your public and followers-only posts are delivered to the servers where your followers reside, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the recipients, in so far as those followers or recipients reside on a different server than this.\n\nWhen you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you approve, it may access your public profile information, your following list, your followers, your lists, all your posts, and your favorites. Applications can never access your e-mail address or password.\n\n#### Site usage by children\n\nOur site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 16 years old.

                "PRIVACY POLICY\n\nYiffit.net is a service that allows you to send and receive social content such as text posts, links, images, comments, direct messages etc. as well as sending and receiving social interactions such as upvotes, downvotes, bookmarks, etc. to and from users across the internet.\n\nYiffit.net's software, known as Lemmy, works by creating for each of its users both an inbox and outbox with which they can receive and send social content over the internet. \n\nUsers can receive content from both other Yiffit.net users and communities (local) as well as users and communities from across the internet (remote). Content from this inbox is then displayed in form of a \"feed\" or \"timeline\", representing a list of content such as posts and comments which the user has subscribed to or might find interesting.\n\nWhen creating new content or performing an action that interacts with existing content or users, Yiffit.net's server will place this interaction in the user's outbox and immediately deliver it on the user's behalf to all known (by the Yiffit.net server) users and communities across the internet as part of the process of communicating these social interactions and being able to offer a social network experience.\n\nWhen a remote user, community or server requests information about social content hosted on Yiffit.net (for example, when trying to access the user's profile), Yiffit.net will also send on behalf of the user a list of social interactions that are part of the user's public profile.\n\nIn summary: in order to be able to provide a social network experience with users who are not members of Yiffit.net, the user authorizes Yiffit.net to request content and send content on the user's behalf to and from other users, communities and servers across the internet. Yiffit.net acts thus as a messaging system to receive and send social content and interactions to and from across the internet and then display them on screen in a coherent way that allows the user to read the content and interact with it.\n\nSending and receiving social content and interactions to and from other users on the internet is similar to email. Yiffit.net does not control, own or have access to the inbox of remote users, communities and servers. \n\n**By using the website Yiffit.net the user understands and accepts that the content of any interaction such as messages, posts, upvotes, downvotes, bookmarks, etc... is immediately sent and delivered across the internet.** As such, the user understands and accepts that any content and interaction is inherently public and that it is not possible to guarantee the removal or deletion of any copies of such interactions that were delivered to remote users, communities and servers across the internet.\n\n**Yiffit.net never shares or sends personal identifiable information such as IP addresses, email addresses or browsing meta-data.** Yiffit.net will only send on behalf of the user interactions that they have performed on the site as well as public details that make up the user's social profile such as username, profile description, profile photo, profile banner, etc.\n\nSince the nature of the social interactions on Yiffit.net is public, we recommend users to choose a username that will not publicly identify them unless they willingly decide to do so and understand that any interactions on the site may be public, as well as the fact that Yiffit.net has no ability to control or remove data from the inbox of remote servers after such an interaction has been sent out. We can only request that remote servers delete or hide content that has already been received by them, but we have no ability to enforce its removal.\n\nIt is worth noting that \"direct messages\" to other users are only sent to the server where the other user has their inbox. If the recipient of a direct message is a Yiffit.net user, then that message will NOT be broadcast or sent across the internet. When direct messages are sent to non-yiffit.net users, then they are sent in an encrypted and secure manner with the use of TLS certificates. However, it's worth noting that once they have arrived at their destination, direct messages are not stored in an encrypted manner in the database and that any person managing the server where the remote inbox is located could potentially have access to their message. So called Direct Messages are an exception to most if not all other social interactions on Yiffit.net which are almost always public in nature, and even Direct Messages shoud not be used to convey critically sensitive information due to the risk of being read by malicious remote server administrators.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Yiffit.net will not send out images to remote servers. Images are hosted by Yiffit.net and will have to be requested to our server for them to be displayed to remote users. However, we do not have the ability to guarantee that remote servers or users will not cache them or save a copy.\n\n**The user accepts and agrees not to hold Yiffit.net, its administrators, moderators and users liable for any damages, negative consequences, impact to their reputation, financial losses, etc. that derive from Yiffit.net fulfilling its role and task as a service to receive, deliver and publicly broadcast the social content and interactions that the user does when using the social platform offered by Yiffit.net**\n\nThe user also understands and accepts that due to the way the software Yiffit.net uses works (lemmy), that currently any messages the user deletes are still visible by administrators and community moderators (only the community they were sent in), whether local or remote. We do not like this behavior for deleted messages and will work in the following months to implement features that allow users to delete messages and broadcast a request to other servers to also delete this content, not just hide it from users.\n\nCurrently we recommend our users to edit their message before deleting them. Lemmy does not keep version history and this should ensure that content is removed by replacing it with any other arbitrary content (or leaving it blank) as long as remote servers accept the user's request to alter the content, to hide it from users, to not keep a version history or to delete it from its database. Yiffit.net can not guarantee that remote users, communities or servers will comply with such requests and we recommend our users treat everything they write or do on this platform as irreversibly public. Please consider our recommendation to use an alias as a username to protect your privacy.\n\nYiffit.net is a non-commercial personal project. By using Yiffit.net the user accepts and understands that there are no guarantees of availability and that the administrator of Yiffit.net may not be held liable for any negative consequences suffered if the site stops working, were to disappear completely, any loss of data and/or bugs in the software that Yiffit.net uses to provide this voluntary and private service. That said, we will do our best to keep the uptime as high as possible. In the case of permanent service closure we aim to announce it with at least 3 months of anticipation.\n\nWe are committed to the utmost care in regards to personal identifying information, ensuring that we never share or disclose such information to unauthorized third parties. Please find below a list of persons or companies who are authorized to hold, transfer or work with your data in order to be able to make Yiffit.net work.\n\nOther relevant information:\n\n- Yiffit.net is hosted on a dedicated server in Germany. Backups are also hosted in Germany.\n- Only @Wander@yiffit.net has access to the server and the data that it contains.\n- Mailjet.com is our email delivery provider and they have access to your email and other information contained within those emails in order to be able to send you emails.\n- Cloudflare R2 is our object storage provider. We are using their 'western europe' endpoint.\n- Cloudflare is also used to protect our server from DDoS attacks and technically could see data in transit.\n- Site admins and moderators cannot access your email address or IP address.\n- IP logs are retained for 14 days for moderation purposes only (ie. detect and prevent abuse by malicious actors registering multiple accounts)",

We may even find a [mentor](https://community.kde.org/Mentoring) for you!\n\n* The KDE Community develops and distributes open source software. As such, we follow a sort of do-ocracy wherein tasks are done and assigned by contributors themselves. Feel free to pick an area and just start contributing immediately! We're always here to help you along the way.

Don't do that please.\n- We are not hosted in Malaysia.\n\n### Privacy\n\n- We will not sell or otherwise disclose your data, unless required by law.\n- Lemmy does some basic activity logging, which we retain on whatever its default settings are, e.g. cookies so you stay logged in, IP addresses for ban evasion.\n- Like any other online forum, site admins have direct database access, and sometimes need to use it (migrations, capacity issues, dealing with spam). Please act accordingly. For example, you don't need to provide an email address to create an account if this makes you uncomfortable.\n- We are not a commercial organisation. As such, the Malaysian PDPA does not apply to us: this strictly only governs commercial transactions. For similar reasons, neither do the GDPR, CCPA, and COPPA.\n\n### Special Thanks\n\n* Thank you to the great minds of the r/Malaysia Discord server for coming up with the site name!

                "## Privacy Policy\nWe provide this information according to the [EU Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN) for those who consult the website https://dormi.zone and request to register. Note that this information applies only to that website and not to other websites the user may consult through links.\n\n## Data controller\nThe data controller is @HKayn@dormi.zone and can be contacted by email to admin@dormizone.com.\n\n## What data is collected\n\nRegarding this point, we must distinguish two steps.\n\n(a) Registration in the community: username, password, and email (optional);\n\n(b) Access to the community and user activities: IP address, username, password, (email).\n\nThe user data (username, password, and email) are recorded in the database, and specifically, the passwords are “hashed” (i.e., transformed into alphanumeric strings using the hash function).\n\n## Access to the community and user activities\n\nHaving completed the account creation process, the user can log in (Login) to the community through the browser, the IP address is acquired.\n\n**Each user is responsible for the content they intend to post on the Lemmy community.**\n\nIn that phase, the personal data of users collected are the username, password, email address, and IP address.\n\n## Who can access the data and for what activities\n\nThe server administrator (instance) can read data of the activities performed on the community recorded on the server and precisely in the database or log files (username, email, IP address, community web address, type of activity - technically GET or POST).\n\nThe administrator only accesses users’ personal data for strictly technical reasons.\n\nWe should point out that access to users’ personal data, whether in the database or logs, is a specific activity that is not generally performed except to resolve particular conflicts or errors.\n\n## The purposes of data processing\n\nThe purpose is to consult this website or interact by posting content, comments, or creating other communities. Accessing this website, and requesting to register as a user, means the user gave consent.\n\nFurthermore, the purposes are also related to server maintenance and system and application upgrades.\n\nThe optional, explicit, and voluntary sending of electronic mail to the addresses indicated on this site involves the acquisition of the sender’s address necessary for the replies and any other personal data contained in the message. These data are processed to respond to messages sent and handle related requests. Failure to provide personal data for communications with us or send requests will prevent evading them. We store data for the time strictly necessary for the purposes related to data processing.\n\n## Legal basis for the processing\n\nThe processing of personal data is based on consent - according to article 6, par. 1, letter a) of EU Regulation 2016/679 - expressed by the user by browsing this website and its consultation, thus accepting this information.\n\nConsent is optional, and the user can withdraw at any time by request sent by email to admin@dormizone.com, specifying that, in this case, whether the user does not consent, they cannot consult this website, either register or remain as a registered user.\n\nRegarding server maintenance and system and application upgrades, the legal basis is the legitimate interest according to Article 6, letter f) of the EU Regulation 2016/679.\n\n## Cookies\n\nThe only cookies are only functional ones and, therefore, no profiling or tracking activities.\n\n**Thus, this site does not use cookies other than functional cookies solely for the functional purposes described above, and their installation does not require the user’s consent.**\n\n## Data recipients\n\nWe do not communicate personal data collected from this website following its consultation to recipients or categories of recipients.\n\n## Period for storing personal data\n\nApart from what is specified above, the data collected by this website during its operation are stored for the time strictly necessary for the activities specified. The data will be deleted or anonymized at the expiry date unless there are no other purposes for storing the same.\n\n## Transferring personal data to a third country or international organization\n\nThe data controller, the administrator of Lemmy’s instance, does not transfer data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) if Lemmy is installed on the server located within the European Economic Area.\n\nWe feel it is appropriate to clarify this further.\n\nUsers registered on an instance are always solely responsible for their activities by creating communities or publishing posts or comments.\n\nThere is no transfer outside the SEE when registered users on an instance within the same EEA perform activities on the same server (instance). For example, our instance (https://dormi.zone) is located in Germany and thus within the EEA. If users registered on our instance perform activities on our server, there is no data transfer outside the EEA. Similarly, there is no data transfer outside the EEA even if registered users on our instance subscribe, publish posts, or comments on other instances - for example - located outside the EEA. Indeed, in the latter case, our instance administrator can access the logs and see only the domain (and thus not even the full URL of the community on which activities are performed) and its IP address. No further user data is transferred outside the EEA by the administrator or automatically by the Lemmy platform. The user should be aware that their username in the form “@username@domainofcommunity” (e.g., in our case, @username@dormi.zone) will be visible in the community in which they have intervened (e.g., to publish posts or comments).\n\nThere will be no transfer of data outside the EEA even if the user intends to create a community on the existing Lemmy instance within the same EEA.\n\nAll of this is because it is a proper function of the fediverse’s system and the ActivityPub protocol used by Lemmy.\n\n## Security measures\n\nVisitors’ or users’ data are processed lawfully and correctly by adopting appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of data. Your data in the communication session with this website are protected by a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate that uses a cryptographic presentation protocol, encrypting the information.\n\n## Data subjects’ rights\n\nUsers (data subject) of this website may exercise the rights according to Articles 15 to 22 of EU Regulation 2016/679. You can lodge all requests to exercise these rights by writing to admin@dormizone.com.\n\n## Right to lodge a complaint\n\nWhether a data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to them as performed via this website infringes the Regulation, they have the right to lodge a complaint with the Garante according to Article 77 of the EU Regulation 2016/679.",

                "### Welcome\nThis is a Federated Lemmy instance that focuses on West Virginia and other topics of interest.  Members are allowed and encouraged to create and grow communities.\n\n\n![](https://fediseer.com/api/v1/badges/endorsements/dubvee.org.svg)\n\n*Montani Semper Liberi*\n\nPlease be good to each other.\n\nThe best way to describe the vibe here is \"[Beehaw](https://beehaw.org,) but with downvotes enabled\".  We expect you to behave yourself and be nice (doesn't make sense to make bee puns here haha). \n\n--- \n### Getting Started\n[Explore the communities](/communities?type=All) already loaded into this instance.  If you don't see what you like, try searching for a community in the [Lemmyverse Explorer](https://lemmyverse.net/communities).  Once you find something that interests you, copy/paste the community link into the [Search](/search) page, wait for it to pull in, and then subscribe.\n\nIf you are using the main frontend (Tesseract), you can browse communities on other instances directly from the [/communities](/communities) page.  Use the gear icon to access the options and either select from one of the provided instances or enter the domain of a custom instance to browse.   \n\n### Image Uploads\nUploaded images are limited to 500 KB.  If you're using the main Tesseract frontend, you can pre-process images to `webp` during the upload to reduce them below that limit. Otherwise, you will need to crop, scale, and/orcompress them before uploading or host them externally (imgur, catbox, etc).\n\n### Instance Rules\nUnless otherwise stated, these rules apply to both local accounts and those interacting from federated instances. \n\n::: spoiler #0 Don't Be a Buzzkill\nWe run reports and can detect mass downvoters, both local and federated, and we do ban them.  If everything here displeases you, then maybe go be miserable somewhere else.   Currently, the ratio is 2:1 downvotes given out to upvotes given (combined post + comments).  \n\nPeople enjoy different things, and this instance is subscribed to a variety of topics.  If you don't like something, move on, block the user/community,  or subscribe to things you DO like - don't browse \"all\" just to jump in the comments to shit all over others.\n:::\n\n::: spoiler #1 Be Civil and Nice\nYou should absolutely not consider this instance a \"bastion of free speech\" in any way, shape or form. Please read our [Free Speech Policy](https://xkcd.com/1357/) for further details.\n\nBe here because you _want_ to be here.  This is *not* a refuge for people who have been banned from other social sites.  If you're here because you've been banned elsewhere, you'll definitely get banned here too - probably faster.  \n\nThere is a zero tolerance policy in place for hate speech, bigotry, racism, sexism, homo/trans-phobia, and any other uncivil or hateful behavior. \n\nInappropriate usernames/display names, especially those containing racist or any other inappropriate slurs will not be approved, and any interacting from remote instances will be banned without warning.\n\n**Definitions of Free Speech**:\n- Free speech:  Done in good faith.   \"I can speak my mind without fear of being arrested\"\n- \"Freeze peach\":  Done in bad faith.  \"I can say the worst things imaginable without consequences because 'free speech, y'all'\"\n\nWe try our best to respect the right to free expression (within the bounds of civility), but \"freeze peach\" will not be tolerated.\n:::\n\n::: spoiler #2 Bot Policy\nIn short, no bots are allowed unless explicitly approved in advance by a site administrator. \n\nApproved bots _must_ flag themselves as a bot and _must_ have their operator's contact info in their bio.  Any/all unauthorized bots or bots that do not identify themselves and their operator will receive a permanent ban; no exceptions.  Bots interacting from remote instances will be banned as well if they are annoying.  \n\nIf you encounter an annoying bot, please report it for evaluation.\n\nIf there is a bot that is banned and you would like to see it unbanned, please DM one of the admins, and we will review it.\n:::\n\n::: spoiler #3 ChatGPT and AI-Generated Content\nI do not care what you asked ChatGPT or asked an \"AI\" to generate for you, and I will not waste resources on my systems hosting it.  AI generated drivel will be removed with prejudice.  This instance is for humans to interact.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: spoiler #4 NSFW and Controversial Content\nIn short:  Try to keep posts and comments rated [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system#R-rated) *at most*, preferably PG-13 or lower.\n\nI don't give a fuck about language; just don't be an asshole.  \n\nPornography is strictly prohibited.  Any content posted that is deemed pornographic will be removed and the account banned.\n\nWe generally also disallow \"moe\" or other similar content because both of the admins here think it's kind of gross to fetishize cartoons like that.  A lot of people disagree, and we realize our generalization of that is controversial, but we have decided to lump that in with NSFW / pornography since it's not something we want to see or moderate.  \n:::\n\n::: spoiler #5 No Advertising/Self-Promotion\nAccounts are prohibited from advertising products or services.  There's a big difference between posting about a cool project you've been working on/found and shilling for a product/company that will be enforced on a know-it-when-we-see-it basis.\n:::\n\n::: spoiler #6 Mis-/Disinformation Policy\nPosts should not deliberately contain or spread disinformation / misinformation.  This includes pushing conspiracy theories. Posts / comments determined to fit that criteria will be removed.   This includes any and all posts from sources MBFC deems low credibility (regardless of community), blogs presented as news, or any other non-news source presented as a news article.\n\nAll links to news articles *must* be to the original source. Link shorteners, archive links, etc are prohibited as the main URL for a post.  If you wish to provide such a link, it must be added as an addendum to the post in the body. The post's URL *must* be to the original source.  This will be enforced for both posts to local communities as well as posts from federated ones.  \n\nRemote communities must also be compatible with this rule.  Remote news communities that do not enforce submission credibility minimums, or those which allow non-credible sources, will be removed upon discovery. Similarly, news/politics communities that encourage archive links instead of canonical URLs will also be removed/hidden.  \n\nThere will be absolutely _no exceptions._ to this rule.\n:::\n\n::: spoiler #7 Agendas, Astroturfing, Sockpuppeting, and Brigading\n\nWe do not allow accounts to push agendas outside of dedicated communities; that's not what we're here for.  This is a little difficult to codify, but basically if you want to push a stance on something, keep it to a community dedicated to that topic.  Local users are free to create and grow a community for this purpose as long as it adheres to all other instance rules.\n\nFor example, if you don't like cars, keep your anti-car sentiment to appropriate communities such as /c/fuckcars rather than dredging up every anti-car post you can find and spreading those across news and other communities.  Similarly, don't jump into the comments of unrelated communities just to push your anti-car stance (unless it's directly relevant).\n\nThis rule sounds way more draconian than it is, but the purpose of it is to discourage brigading and keep communities civil and on topic.\n\nAccounts should not engage in astroturfing, sock-puppeting, or vote manipulation.  Our moderation toolset can detect this, and offending accounts will be banned (local or remote).\n\nVote manipulation is defined as using multiple accounts under the control of a single individual or group to boost or demote specific content (yours or someone else's) for any purpose (pushing a specific narrative, trying to silence someone you disagree with, etc).  Sock puppeting is similarly defined, but for the act of creating a false quorum and steering discourse.  For the purposes of enforcement of this rule, astroturfing is defined the same as sock-puppeting; the difference being that the accounts are possibly operated by different people for the same goal of intentionally steering discourse.\n:::\n\n::: spoiler #8 Absolutely No Extremism\nI don't care which end of the spectrum you're on.  Any post/comment calling for or glorifying violence, especially political violence, will be removed.  Offenders will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but bans will be the norm and swift for violating this rule.\n\nWe define two forms of extremism for the purposes of rule enforcement:\n\n**Explicit Extremism**: \n\n- Explicitly praising or justifying acts of violence\n- Explicitly justifying / advocating for violence / \"revolution\" / whatever\n- Suggesting, justifying, or advocating political violence, vigilantism, and/or breaking with the foundational principles of this country in order to \"solve\" a problem.\n- Hypocritical posts/comments that amount to \"Fascism / authoritarianism / whatever -ism is bad, but a little bit is okay when it's my side doing it\"\n- Stirring the pot by jumping into otherwise civil discussions and suggesting acts of violence \n\n**Implicit Extremism**:\n\n- Patterns of upvoting or boosting posts/comments that explicitly praise, endorse, or advocate for violence (or any of the 'explicit' items above)\n- Patterns of downvoting posts/comments that denounce violence or those that advocate for lawful/peaceful solutions.\n\n:::\n\n---\n\n### Alternate Frontends\nThe default UI for DubVee is called [Tesseract](https://github.com/asimons04/Tesseract) but we also have, sigh, Lemmy UI  if it's not your cup of tea:  [https://lemmy.dubvee.org](https://lemmy.dubvee.org)\n\nYou can also use any app of your preference by installing and/or running it locally and pointing it to DubVee.  \n\nFor a comprehensive list of Lemmy apps, check out https://www.lemmyapps.com",
