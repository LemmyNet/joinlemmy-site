You can also join our community [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZtZzR6TWs2) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/%23beehaw:matrix.org) servers.\n\nOur most up to date [FAQ can be found here](https://docs.beehaw.org/docs/faq/).\n\nDownvotes are disabled on this instance.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nWe're a collective of individuals upset with the way social media has been traditionally governed. A severe lack of moderation has led to major platforms like Facebook to turn into political machinery focused on disinformation campaigns as a way to make profit off of users. Websites with ineffective moderation allow hate speech to proliferate and contribute to the erosion of minority rights and safe spaces. Our goal with Beehaw is to demonstrate and promote a healthier environment.\n\nOur philosophy: \n* [What is Beehaw?](https://docs.beehaw.org/docs/core-principles/what-is-beehaw/)\n* [The spirit of the rules](https://docs.beehaw.org/docs/core-principles/the-spirit-of-beehaw/)\n* [Beehaw is a Community](https://docs.beehaw.org/docs/core-principles/beehaw-is-a-community/)\nand more on our [Docs Website](https://docs.beehaw.org/)\n\nOperating our server costs money. If you donate, you should know that 100% of the costs will go towards server time, licensing costs, and artwork. In the future if we need to hire developers or other labor, it would be sourced through the [Open Collective Foundation](https://opencollective.com/beehaw), and it would be transparent to the community before any changes were made.\n\nAs a news aggregator and a social media outlet, with a focus on being a safe and accepting space, we strive to create a positive social impact. We will, also, help to connect underprivileged and minority individuals with education and civic participation by promoting a healthier online experience.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nOur community icons were made by Aaron Schneider under the [CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).",

                "# Privacy Policy\n\nWe provide this information according to the [EU Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN) for those who consult the website https://feddit.de and request to register. Note that this information applies only to that website and not to other websites the user may consult through links.\n\n## Data controller\n\nThe data controller is [@wintermute@feddit.de](https://feddit.de/u/wintermute) pgcn5lz86@relay.firefox.com\n\n## What data is collected.\n\nRegarding this point, we must distinguish two steps.\n\n(a) Registration in the community: username, password, and email (optional);\n\n(b) Access to the community and user activities: IP address, username, password, (email).\n\nThe user data (username, password, and email) are recorded in the database, and specifically, the passwords are “hashed” (i.e., transformed into alphanumeric strings using the hash function).\n\n### Access to the community and user activities\n\nHaving completed the account creation process, the user can log in (Login) to the community through the browser, the IP address is acquired.\n\n**Each user is responsible for the content they intend to post on the Lemmy community**.\n\nIn that phase, the personal data of users collected are the **username**, **password**, **email address**, and **IP address**.\n\n### Who can access the data and for what activities.\n\nThe server administrator (instance) can read data of the activities performed on the community recorded on the server and precisely in the database or log files (username, email, IP address, community web address, type of activity - technically GET or POST).\n\nThe administrator only accesses users’ personal data for strictly technical reasons.\n\nWe should point out that access to users’ personal data, whether in the database or logs, is a specific activity that is not generally performed except to resolve particular conflicts or errors.\n\n## The purposes of the processing.\n\nThe purpose is to consult this website or interact by posting content, comments, or creating other communities. Accessing this website, and requesting to register as a user, means the user gave consent.\n\nFurthermore, the purposes are also related to server maintenance and system and application upgrades.\n\nThe optional, explicit, and voluntary sending of electronic mail to the addresses indicated on this site involves the acquisition of the sender’s address necessary for the replies and any other personal data contained in the message. These data are processed to respond to messages sent and handle related requests. Failure to provide personal data for communications with us or send requests will prevent evading them. We store data for the time strictly necessary for the purposes related to data processing.\n\n## Legal basis for the processing\n\nThe processing of personal data is based on consent - according to article 6, par. 1, letter a) of EU Regulation 2016/679 - expressed by the user by browsing this website and its consultation, thus accepting this information.\n\nConsent is optional, and the user can withdraw at any time by request sent by email to pgcn5lz86@relay.firefox.com, specifying that, in this case, whether the user does not consent, they cannot consult this website, either register or remain as a registered user.\n\nRegarding server maintenance and system and application upgrades, the legal basis is the legitimate interest according to Article 6, letter f) of the EU Regulation 2016/679.\n\n\n## Cookies\n\nThe only cookies are only **functional ones** and, therefore, no profiling or tracking activities.\n\n**Thus, this site does not use cookies other than functional cookies solely for the functional purposes described above, and their installation does not require the user’s consent**.\n\n## Data recipients\n\nWe do not communicate personal data collected from this website following its consultation to recipients or categories of recipients.\n\n## Period for storing personal data\n\nApart from what is specified above, the data collected by this website during its operation are stored for the time strictly necessary for the activities specified. The data will be deleted or anonymized at the expiry date unless there are no other purposes for storing the same.\n\n## Transferring personal data to a third country or international organization\n\nThe data controller, the administrator of Lemmy’s instance, does not transfer data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) if Lemmy is installed on the server located within the European Economic Area.\n\nWe feel it is appropriate to clarify this further.\n\nUsers registered on an instance are always solely responsible for their activities by creating communities or publishing posts or comments.\n\nThere is no transfer outside the SEE when registered users on an instance within the same EEA perform activities on the same server (instance). For example, our instance (https://feddit.de) is located in Germany and thus within the EEA. If users registered on our instance perform activities on our server, there is no data transfer outside the EEA. Similarly, there is no data transfer outside the EEA even if registered users on our instance subscribe, publish posts, or comments on other instances - for example - located outside the EEA. Indeed, in the latter case, our instance administrator can access the logs and see only the domain (and thus not even the full URL of the community on which activities are performed) and its IP address. No further user data is transferred outside the EEA by the administrator or automatically by the Lemmy platform. The user should be aware that their username in the form “@username@domainofcommunity” (e.g., in our case, @username@feddit.de) will be visible in the community in which they have intervened (e.g., to publish posts or comments).\n\nThere will be no transfer of data outside the EEA even if the user intends to create a community on the existing Lemmy instance within the same EEA.\n\nAll of this is because it is a proper function of the fediverse’s system and the ActivityPub protocol used by Lemmy.\n\n## Security measures\n\nVisitors’ or users’ data are processed lawfully and correctly by adopting appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of data. Your data in the communication session with this website are protected by a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate that uses a cryptographic presentation protocol, encrypting the information.\n\n## Data subjects’ rights\n\nUsers (data subject) of this website may exercise the rights according to Articles 15 to 22 of EU Regulation 2016/679. You can lodge all requests to exercise these rights by writing to pgcn5lz86@relay.firefox.com\n\n## Right to lodge a complaint\n\nWhether a data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to them as performed via this website infringes the Regulation, they have the right to lodge a complaint with the Garante according to Article 77 of the EU Regulation 2016/679.",

                'This privacy policy describes how lemm.ee ("lemm.ee", "we", "us") collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information you may provide through the lemm.ee website or its API. The policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This policy also describes how your engagement (profile information, posts, comments, direct messages, votes) is distributed and accessed. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or organizations that lemm.ee does not own or control, or to individuals that lemm.ee does not employ or manage.\n\nBy joining this service you are engaging in, and contributing to, the very exciting and emerging space of free open communication on the internet. **HOWEVER YOU ARE JOINING WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS SERVICE IS RUNNING ON VERY EARLY RELEASE SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ENTIRELY EXPERIMENTAL. ALTHOUGH ALL REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA, WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE OR THIS INSTANCE CONFIGURATION IS FREE FROM DEFECT THAT MAY RESULT IN THE EXPOSURE OF ANY OR ALL SUBMITTED DATA.** \n\n**You also understand that there are controls to prevent the distribution of your email and IP address. However due to the nature of federated services, all of your *engagement* (your profile;posts;comments;messages;votes) on this platform should be considered public. We feel that proper precautions should be taken by the user regardless of what services they choose to use to engage in internet discourse, but it is highly recommended that you do not share any information on lemm.ee, or the Lemmy platform, that could in any way personally identify you.**\n\n# **What information do we collect?**\n\n* **Basic account information**: If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password. You may also enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture. The username, display name, biography, profile picture are always listed publicly.\n* **Posts, comments, subscribing, voting, and other public information**:  When you post, the date and time is stored as well as the application you posted from. Posts and comments may contain media attachments, such as pictures and videos. Posts and comments are available publicly. Anything displayed on your profile is also publicly available information. Your comment history is available publicly. Your posts are delivered to the communities they are posted on, in some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. When you delete posts, this is likewise broadcast to other instances, however there is no guarantee that the removal request will be respected, or even broadcast to all instances. There are conditions that may result in copies of your profile, posts, comments, voting record not being removed or editable when requesting so from your local instance. Communities you subscribe to may be disclosed to the admins of remote instances. Although user vote records are not accessible through the UI, this should also be considered public, and there are conditions which result in it becoming publicly viewable. This service interoperates with other federated services such as Mastodon; the format, interpretation, and display of your engagement may function differently than it does on Lemmy. \n \n**In essence, your IP address and email remain private to this local instance, however due to the nature of federated services all *engagement* (your profile;posts;comments;messages;votes) should be considered public and you are responsible for taking appropriate precautions in how you engage. Do not share any sensitive or information you do not want public over Lemmy.** \n  \n* **Direct messages**: All messages are stored and processed on the instance. In some cases it means they are delivered to different instances and copies are stored there. We make a good faith effort to limit the access to these direct messages to only authorized persons, but other instances may fail to do so. Therefore it\'s important to review the instances of users you are engaging with. **Please keep in mind that the operators of the instance and any receiving instance may view such messages**, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. **Do not share any sensitive information over Lemmy.**\n* **IPs and other metadata**: When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.\n\n# **What do we use your information for?**\n\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n\n\n* To provide the core functionality of Lemmy. You can only engage with other people\'s content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may subscribe to other communities for content discovery.\n* To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.\n* The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.\n\n\n# **How do we protect your information?**\n\nWe implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. \n\n\n# **Do we use cookies?**\n\nYes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer\'s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.\n\nWe use cookies to authenticate users.\n\n# **Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**\n\nWe do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.\n\nYour public content will be sent to other federated servers in the network. Your public and community posts are delivered to the servers where the community resides, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the recipients, in so far as those communities or recipients reside on a different server than this.\n\nWhen you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you approve, it may access your public profile information, your subscription list, all your posts, and your voting history. Applications can never access your e-mail address or password from the API, however it may be required to give access to your account (ie. logging in).\n\n\n# **Site usage by children**\n\nOur site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 16 years old. If you are under the age of 16, per the requirements of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) do not use this site.\n\n---\n\nThis document is CC-BY-SA.

                "> If there's content from communities you don't want to see, then [**switch your default view type to `Subscribed`**](https://lemmynsfw.com/settings). You can also **block** the communities you don't wish to interact with **at all**. Also for finding communities combining those existing in the fediverse as well as within this instance, use [lemmyverse.net/communities](https://lemmyverse.net/communities)\n# Rules\nBefore you start participating, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our rules:\n1. 🔞 **Age Requirement**: All participants __**MUST**__ be 18 or over. Additionally, this should go without saying, **but posting content involving any person(s) who is under 18 is Forbidden**.\n\n2. **Respect and Consent**: Treat all members with respect and obtain consent when sharing explicit content involving others. Don't be an asshole.\n\n3. **Content Guidelines**: Share relevant content in the relevant communities and ensure your content complies with these rules, and the rules of the Community you are posting in.\n\n4. [**No NSFL/Gore Content**](https://lemmynsfw.com/post/264): We strictly prohibit the sharing or promotion of NSFL (Not Safe For Life) or gore content. \n\n5. **NSFW Flag**: All NSFW communities and contents **must** be flagged as such.\n\n6. **No Illegal Content**: The sharing or promotion of anything illegal is prohibited.\n\n7. **Self-Promotion**: Self-Promotion is only okay **as long as** the community you are posting in allows it, and you don't spam it.\n\n8. **NSFW User Avatar**: NSFW user avatars are **prohibited** as it is currently not possible to mark users as NSFW.\n\n9. **Temporary Content Restrictions**: The following content is temporarily restricted: Hot lunch (🤮), blood, scat. \nWe plan on allowing this content again once Lemmy evolves as a platform and moderation tools improve.  [More info is available here](https://lemmynsfw.com/post/126890) in regards to this policy, and we will have more discussions about our content policy in the future.\n\n10. **Permanent forbidden content**: These are subjects which are not allowed on this server and will result in purging and banning. This restriction apply to real or fictional depictions of the following subjects expressed in any medium including live action, photography, cartoons, comics, illustration, 3dcg, text, audio, etc. :\n- Content involving persons under the age of 18, real or fictional. This includes \"aged-up\" version of underaged characters, all loli/shota/cub content, and attempted end-runs like the \"3000 year old dragon lolita\" trope. This does not include people discussing their own IRL experiences before the age of 18, as long as the discussion is factual, relevant, and not graphic or intended to arouse.\n- Bestiality/zoophilia with any animal. This includes fantasy animals like unicorns, Cerberus, or Pokémon. It does not include furries.\n- Any content made or released without consent of the model, including but not limited to \"revenge porn\", deepfakes made without explicit consent, true voyeur content (upskirts, hidden camera, etc), the Girls Gone Wild franchise (yes, we know some of that was made with consent, but a lot of it wasn't and we will not be responsible for separating the two), and mainstream porn from studios and/or creators that have been outed as practicing noncon.\n- True noncon (rape), or anything indistinguishable from true noncon. CNC is allowed but it must be easily distinguishable as **C**NC (for example, kink.com-style pre- and post-scene interviews, or sauce with obvious context). We want to allow CNC communities here, but to do that we need to be sure about the first C. \n- Gore or snuff. This includes fictional snuff scenarios. \n- If any material is ambiguous or borderline forbidden content, we're usually going to err on the side of caution. Please use your common sense. **As moderation tools improve, we will open the floor to community feedback to see if any of these rules need to change or be clarified.**\n\nAll users and communities must follow and respect these general instance-wide rules.\n***Any violations could result in bans from Lemmy NSFW.***\n\n> As for the Admins of other instances, if there are any issues with Lemmy NSFW please raise it with one of our admins so we can communicate on how we can improve this instance, without the need to resort to defederating it.\n___\n# Contact\n###### Mail: xaeg@protonmail.com\n###### Matrix: @xaeg:matrix.org\n###### Mastodon: [@lemmynsfw@mastodon.world](https://mastodon.world/@lemmynsfw)\n###### Matrix public operations room (SFW only): [#lemmynsfw:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#lemmynsfw:matrix.org)\n\n___\n# Donations\n- [Github ![Github Sponsors](https://img.shields.io/github/sponsors/xaegreal?logo=github)](https://github.com/sponsors/xaegreal/)\n- [Patreon ![Patreon Support](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fshieldsio-patreon.vercel.app%2Fapi%3Fusername%3Dxaeg%26type%3Dpatrons&style=flat&label=%20&labelColor=%23052d49&color=%23f96854)](https://patreon.com/xaeg)\n- [Ethereum (ETH)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e4af5dc2f86235ac496542c2a1c00f3c4de40c6)\n- [Monero (XMR)](/xmr-address)\n- [Ripple (XRP)](https://xrpscan.com/account/rJRiM1spu2s1vQUWLWuBAKdCXejRS4wjvi)",

                'This privacy policy describes how Sopuli ("Sopuli", "we", "us") collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information you may provide through the Sopuli website or its API. The policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This policy also describes how your engagement (profile information, posts, comments, direct messages, votes) is distributed and accessed. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or organizations that Sopuli does not own or control, or to individuals that Sopuli does not employ or manage.\n\nBy joining this service you are engaging in, and contributing to, the very exciting and emerging space of free open communication on the internet. **HOWEVER YOU ARE JOINING WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS SERVICE IS RUNNING ON VERY EARLY RELEASE SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ENTIRELY EXPERIMENTAL. ALTHOUGH ALL REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA, WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE OR THIS INSTANCE CONFIGURATION IS FREE FROM DEFECT THAT MAY RESULT IN THE EXPOSURE OF ANY OR ALL SUBMITTED DATA.**\n\n**You also understand that although there are controls to prevent the distribution of your email and IP address, due to the nature of federated services, all of your engagement on this platform should be considered public. We feel that proper precautions should be taken by the user regardless of what services they choose to use to engage in internet discourse, but it is highly recommended that you do not share any information on Sopuli, or the Lemmy platform, that could in any way personally identify you.**\n\n# **What information do we collect?**\n\n* **Basic account information**: If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password. You may also enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture. The username, display name, biography, profile picture are always listed publicly.\n\n* **Posts, comments, subscribing, voting, and other public information**: Communities you subscribe to may be disclosed to the admins of remote instances. Although user vote records are not accessible through the UI, this should also be considered public, and there are conditions which result in it becoming publicly viewable. When you post, the date and time is stored as well as the application you posted from. Posts and comments may contain media attachments, such as pictures and videos. Posts and comments are available publicly. Anything displayed on your profile is also publicly available information. Your comment history is available publicly. Your posts are delivered to the communities they are posted on, in some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. When you delete posts, this is likewise broadcast to other instances, however there is no guarantee that the removal request will be respected, or even broadcast to all instances. There are conditions that may result in copies of your profile, posts, comments, voting record not being removed or editable when requesting so from your local instance. This service interoperates with other federated services such as Mastodon; the format, interpretation, and display of your engagement may function differently than it does on Lemmy. \n\n**In essence, your IP address and email remain private to this local instance, however due to the nature of federated services all engagement should be considered public and you are responsible for taking appropriate precautions in how you engage. Do not share any sensitive or information you do not want public over Lemmy.** \n  \n* **Direct messages**: All messages are stored and processed on the instance. In some cases it means they are delivered to different instances and copies are stored there. We make a good faith effort to limit the access to these direct messages to only authorized persons, but other instances may fail to do so. Therefore it\'s important to review the instances of users you are engaging with. **Please keep in mind that the operators of the instance and any receiving instance may view such messages**, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. **Do not share any sensitive information over Lemmy.**\n\n* **IPs and other metadata**: When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. The latest IP address used is stored for up to 12 months. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.\n\n\n# **What do we use your information for?**\n\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n\n\n\n* To provide the core functionality of Lemmy. You can only engage with other people\'s content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may subscribe to other communities for content discovery.\n\n* To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.\n\n* The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.\n\n\n# **How do we protect your information?**\n\nWe implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. \n\nWe are disclosing that Lemmy currently does not support SSL for PostgreSQL. This instance has mitigated this security risk by running the PostgreSQL service on the same host as the instance backend, and has blocked all incoming and outgoing network connections to the PostgreSQL service **OR** hosts the PostgreSQL database on a separate server and connects via a secure tunnel. All incoming and outgoing network access to the PostgreSQL server outside of this secured tunnel has been blocked\n\n\n# **What is our data retention policy?**\n\nWe will make a good faith effort to:\n\n* Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server, in so far as such logs are kept, no more than 90 days.\n* Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users no more than 12 months.\n\nYou may irreversibly delete your account at any time. **However, this does not guarantee all instances will be notified or respect the deletion of your public data.**\n\n# **Do we use cookies?**\n\nYes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer\'s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.\n\nWe use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.\n\n# **Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**\n\nWe do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.\n\nYour public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your public and community posts are delivered to the servers where the community resides, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the recipients, in so far as those communities or recipients reside on a different server than this.\n\nWhen you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you approve, it may access your public profile information, your subscription list, all your posts, and your voting history. Applications can never access your e-mail address or password from the API, however it may be required to give access to your account (ie. logging in).\n\n# **Site usage by children**\n\nOur site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 16 years old. If you are under the age of 16, per the requirements of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) do not use this site.\n\n---\n\nThis document is CC-BY-SA.

(This can be changed in your settings at a later date)\n\n## Before continuing please make sure you:\n\n- Read the rules: [over here](https://reddthat.com/post/9701)\n- Include which community you would like to join: [list of communities](https://reddthat.com/communities)\n- Also include how many subscribers they have (as a way to prove you are human)\n\n## Why do you need to answer this:\n\nWe touch on the problems we are facing with the removal of the captcha in [our latest announcement](https://reddthat.com/post/178359).\n\n::: spoiler A full explanation is hidden here\nWe are setting this as a temporary measure to ensure you are human, and to protect everyone on our instance from automated signup bots. \n\nUnfortunately, due to the recent removal of the captcha system on Lemmy (the app that we are running) this has unfortunately made it easy for bots to completely automate the signup process and cause havoc on other servers, and on the fediverse as a whole.\n:::\n\n## When will my application be accepted?\nWe do not require email verification or require your email address to signup, but without putting in an email you will **not** get a notification when your approval process is complete. Applications are usually acted upon within 10 minutes, but may take longer.  \nI do not want your email address! I am happy not knowing it and I am happy not knowing anything about you! The less I know the better!  \nSo if you do not enter in an email address come back after 30 minutes and try logging in. Most of the time, you should be sorted. \n\nThank you for your understanding and I cannot wait to see your application. \n\nCheers,  \nTiff\n',

                "#### Cos'è Fedd**it**\nFedd**it** è l'alternativa italiana a Reddit, basata sul software [Lemmy](https://www.lealternative.net/2022/04/06/cose-lemmy/), uno dei progetti più interessanti del [fediverso](https://peertube.uno/w/pvfVP39daxnZcxCJobSPwY?subtitle=it).\n\n#### Informazioni\nQuesto server di **Lemmy** è gestito da [Poliverso](https://poliverso.org/) e [Le Alternative](https://www.lealternative.net/).\n\n#### Regole\n\n🇮🇹 In questo server è necessario scrivere principalmente utilizzando la lingua italiana.\n\n🛎 Attualmente prima di poter aprire una comunità è necessaria l'approvazione degli amministratori [@poliverso@feddit.it](https://feddit.it/u/poliverso)  o [@skariko@feddit.it](https://feddit.it/u/skariko). Potete aprire una richiesta [cliccando qui](https://feddit.it/c/main), spiegando di cosa parlerà la comunità e come sarà gestita.\n\n📜 Ogni comunità sceglierà in autonomia le sue regole, i suoi moderatori e le sue esigenze. Non sarà tuttavia possibile aprire comunità con contenuti pornografici, illegali o con discriminazioni razziali o di genere.\n\n🚯 Le comunità politiche dovranno accettare e sottoscrivere una clausola sull'antifascismo.\n\n⛔️ Lo spam, i bot e i messaggi ripetuti o molesti saranno rimossi a prescindere dalle regole della comunità.\n\n♻️ Le comunità che non riusciranno ad auto-moderarsi verranno richiamate dagli admin e se non sarà possibile trovare una soluzione verranno eliminate.\n\n#### Come si mantiene Feddit?\n\n🧡 È un progetto indipendente e senza pubblicità, se volete potete aiutare la gestione di questo server con una piccola [donazione ricorrente su LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/Feddit-it) oppure con una [donazione una tantum su Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/fedditit).\n\nGrazie! 🧡\n\n📧 Per informazioni sull'istanza potete scrivere a lemmy@feddit.it",

                "### Privacy policy\n\n\nForniamo questa informativa ai sensi del Regolamento UE 2016/679 (GDPR) per coloro che consultano il sito https://feddit.it e chiedono di registrarsi. Si precisa che l'informativa è resa solo per tale sito e non anche per altri siti web eventualmente consultati dall'utente tramite link.\n\n### Titolare del trattamento\n\nTitolare del trattamento è Francesco Macchia\n\nemail: francesco.macchia [at] gmail .it \n\n### Quali dati vengono raccolti.\n\nRiguardo a questo punto, dobbiamo distinguere due passaggi.\n\n(a) Registrazione nella community: nome utente, password ed e-mail;\n\n(b) Accesso alla comunità e attività dell'utente: indirizzo IP, nome utente, password ed e-mail.\n\nI dati dell'utente (username, password ed email) vengono registrati nel database e, nello specifico, le password vengono convertite in “hash” (ovvero trasformate in stringhe alfanumeriche mediante la funzione hash).\n\n### Accesso alla comunità e alle attività degli utenti\n\nDopo aver completato il processo di creazione dell'account, l'utente può accedere (Login) alla comunità tramite il browser, quindi viene acquisito l'indirizzo IP.\n\n*Ogni utente è responsabile dei contenuti che intende pubblicare sulla community di feddit.it.*\n\nIn questa fase, i dati personali degli utenti raccolti sono *username , password , indirizzo email e indirizzo IP.*\n\n### Chi può accedere ai dati e per quali attività.\n\nL'amministratore del server (istanza) può leggere i dati delle attività svolte sulla community registrati sul server e precisamente nel database o nei file di log (username, email, indirizzo IP, indirizzo web della community, tipo di attività - tecnicamente GET o POST).\n\nL'amministratore accede ai dati personali degli utenti solo per motivi strettamente tecnici (analisi del sistema, aggiornamento dei pacchetti applicativi, esigenze di manutenzione).\n\nSi precisa che l'accesso ai dati personali degli utenti, sia nel database che nei log, è un'attività specifica che generalmente non viene svolta se non per risolvere conflitti o errori particolari.\n\n### Le finalità del trattamento.\n\nLo scopo è consultare questo sito web o interagire pubblicando contenuti, commenti o creando altre community. L'accesso a questo sito Web e la richiesta di registrazione come utente implicano che l'utente ha prestato il proprio consenso.\n\nInoltre, le finalità sono anche legate alla manutenzione dei server e agli aggiornamenti di sistemi e applicazioni.\n\nL'invio facoltativo, esplicito e volontario di posta elettronica agli indirizzi indicati su questo sito comporta la successiva acquisizione dell'indirizzo del mittente, necessario per le risposte, nonché degli eventuali altri dati personali inseriti nella missiva. Tali dati sono trattati per rispondere ai messaggi inviati e gestire le relative richieste. Il mancato conferimento dei dati personali per le comunicazioni con noi o l'invio di richieste impedirà di evaderli. Conserviamo i dati per il tempo strettamente necessario alle finalità legate al trattamento dei dati.\n\n### Base giuridica del trattamento\n\nIl trattamento dei dati personali è basato sul consenso - ai sensi dell'art. 6, par. 1, lettera a) del Regolamento UE 2016/679 - espressa dall'utente con la navigazione in questo sito web e la sua consultazione, accettando così la presente informativa.\n\nIl consenso è facoltativo, e l'utente può revocarlo in qualsiasi momento mediante richiesta inviata via email all'indirizzo francesco.macchia [at] gmail.com , precisando che, in tal caso, qualora l'utente non acconsenta, non potrà consultare il presente sito web, né registrarsi né rimanere come utente registrato.\n\nPer quanto riguarda la manutenzione dei server e gli aggiornamenti di sistemi e applicazioni, la base giuridica è il legittimo interesse ai sensi dell'articolo 6, lettera f) del Regolamento UE 2016/679.\n\nIl trattamento dei dati personali è necessario per il perseguimento del legittimo interesse del titolare del trattamento a fornire informazioni in merito a studi e ricerche, ai sensi dell'art. 6, par. 1, lettera f) del Regolamento UE 2016/679, in conformità a quanto previsto dal medesimo Regolamento.\n\n### Cookies\n\nGli unici cookie sono *solo quelli funzionali* e, quindi, nessuna attività di profilazione o tracciamento.\n\n*Pertanto, questo sito non utilizza cookie diversi dai cookie funzionali esclusivamente per le finalità funzionali sopra descritte e la loro installazione non richiede il consenso dell'utente.*\n\n### Destinatari dei dati\n\nNon comunichiamo a destinatari o categorie di destinatari i dati personali raccolti da questo sito web a seguito della sua consultazione.\n\n### Periodo di conservazione dei dati personali\n\nA parte quanto sopra specificato, i dati raccolti da questo sito durante il suo funzionamento sono conservati per il tempo strettamente necessario alle attività precisate. I dati saranno cancellati o anonimizzati alla data di scadenza a meno che non sussistano altre finalità di conservazione degli stessi. Per scopi di analisi (statistiche), utilizziamo Matomo ma a condizione che tu abbia acconsentito a ciò fornendo il consenso una volta raggiunto questo sito.\n\n### Trasferimento di dati personali verso un paese terzo o un'organizzazione internazionale\n\nIl sito feddit.it, in quanto completamente basato sul progetto Lemmy, dispone di un sistema che consente di generare un feed per ciascun oggetto della comunità. I dati riportati nel messaggio non sono costituiti da dati personali e consistono in:\n\n- username dell'utente\n\n- Titolo del post\n\n- Identificativo della comunità feddit nella quale è stato pubblicato\n\n- Data di pubblicazione\n\n- Testo del messaggio\n\n- Link pubblicato dall'autore del messaggio\n\n- Link del messaggio\n\nQuesta peculiarità della piattaforma Lemmy e il fatto che tali dati non possano essere considerati come \"dati personali\" consente a chiunque di operare un trattamento massivo e automatizzato di tali dati, per qualunque fine consentito dalla normativa nazionale ed europea.\nAttualmente esiste già un sistema di ripubblicazione automatica che provvede a copiare sul canale Telegram https://t.me/feddit e sul profilo Twitter https://twitter.com/feddit_it tutti i post di apertura pubblicati all'interno delle comunità.\n\nResta fermo il fatto che il titolare del trattamento, l'amministratore dell'istanza di Lemmy, non trasferisce i dati al di fuori dello Spazio Economico Europeo (SEE) dal momento che Lemmy è installato sul server situato all'interno dello Spazio Economico Europeo.\n\nCi sembra opportuno chiarire meglio.\n\nGli utenti registrati su un'istanza sono sempre gli unici responsabili delle loro attività creando comunità o pubblicando post o commenti.\n\nNon vi è alcun trasferimento al di fuori del SEE quando gli utenti registrati su un'istanza all'interno dello stesso SEE eseguono attività sullo stesso server (istanza). Ad esempio, la nostra istanza ( https://feddit.it) si trova in Italia e quindi all'interno del SEE. Se gli utenti registrati sulla nostra istanza eseguono attività sul nostro server, non vi è alcun trasferimento di dati al di fuori del SEE. Allo stesso modo, non vi è alcun trasferimento di dati al di fuori del SEE anche se gli utenti registrati sulla nostra istanza si iscrivono, pubblicano post o commenti su altre istanze, ad esempio, situate al di fuori del SEE. Infatti, in quest'ultimo caso, il nostro amministratore di istanza può accedere ai log e vedere solo il dominio (e quindi nemmeno l'URL completo della community su cui si svolgono le attività) e il suo indirizzo IP. Nessun ulteriore dato dell'utente viene trasferito al di fuori del SEE dall'amministratore o automaticamente dalla piattaforma Lemmy. L'utente deve essere consapevole che il proprio nome utente è costituito nella forma \"@username@domainofcommunity\" (ad esempio, nel nostro caso, @username@feddit.it.\n\nNon ci sarà alcun trasferimento di dati al di fuori del SEE anche se l'utente intende creare una comunità sull'istanza Lemmy esistente all'interno dello stesso SEE.\n\nTutto questo perché è una funzione propria del sistema fediverse e del protocollo ActivityPub utilizzato da Lemmy.\n\n### Misure di sicurezza\n\nI dati dei visitatori o degli utenti sono trattati in modo lecito e secondo correttezza, adottando le opportune misure di sicurezza volte ad impedire accessi non autorizzati, divulgazione, modifica o distruzione non autorizzata dei dati. I tuoi dati nella sessione di comunicazione con questo sito Web sono protetti da un certificato Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) che utilizza un protocollo di presentazione crittografico, crittografando le informazioni.\n\n### Diritti degli interessati\n\nGli utenti (interessati) di questo sito web possono esercitare i diritti di cui agli artt. da 15 a 22 del Regolamento UE 2016/679. Puoi inoltrare tutte le richieste per esercitare tali diritti scrivendo a francesco.macchia [at] gmail.com\n\n### Diritto di sporgere denuncia\n\nQualora l'interessato ritenga che il trattamento dei dati personali che lo riguardano effettuato attraverso questo sito violi il Regolamento, ha il diritto di proporre reclamo al Garante ai sensi dell'art. 77 del Regolamento UE 2016/679.\n\n### Attribuzione\n\nParti di questi termini di servizio sono state prese da eupolicy.social e adattate da https://mastodon.nicfab.it/privacy-policy#Informativa_Privacy_IT.",

                'Mander is a place to share science and nature related content. We can discuss about growing mushrooms, physics, electronics, engineering, discuss scientific papers, and discuss about other STEM and nature related topics. The policy is to try to stay way from politics and polarizing topics as much as possible when it comes to content posted locally, but you are of course free to post and engage with such content in communities that allow it and live in other instances. \n\nWhile strict rules to avoid harmful interactions are enforced on content posted locally to this instance, this instance has a very open federation policy. This means that through the "All" tab of the instance you will encounter content from most other Lemmy instances - including potentially offensive and harmful content. If you are looking for a more curated interaction with the rest of the fediverse, I strongly recommend you to try a different instance with a federation policy that aligns better with your views. \n\nBecause of the open federation policy, I cannot guarantee that the content accessible through the instance when browsing "All" will be appropriate for minors. Please state in your response that you are comfortable with an open federation policy, and that you are at least 18 years of age. \n\nIf you want to create an account in a different instance, you can easily find our communities through the Lemmy Community-Browser by searching for mander.xyz: https://browse.feddit.de/\n\nIncluding your e-mail can be helpful for receiving a notification when your application is approved and for resetting your password if you forget it, but it is **NOT** required, and you can always add it later if you need to. If you leave the e-mail field empty, simply try to log-in later to check your application status.\n\n',

Hvad vil du gerne snakke med andre om på Feddit.dk? Hvad interesserer du dig for?\n2. Hvor kommer dit brugernavn fra?\n3. Har du læst reglerne? Du kan finde dem i sidebaren på [forsiden](https://feddit.dk) (på mobil skal du gå til forsiden og derefter klikke "Sidebar"-knappen).\n4. Formulér regel 1 i dine egne ord. Hvad vil du selv gøre for at holde den gode tone og være en positiv indflydelse på siden?\n\nBemærk at din ansøgning vil blive vurderet af et menneske; der er ingen automatisk vurdering. Hvis du ikke er blevet godkendt inden for 24 timer betyder det at din ansøgning blev afvist. Du kan kontakte SorteKanin på Reddit hvis du har spørgsmål.\n\n# Hvorfor kræves der en ansøgning?\nSociale medier ejet af firmaer (såsom Facebook, Twitter eller Reddit) har en interesse i at forøge antallet af deres brugere, da det giver dem mulighed for at tjene flere penge gennem reklamer. Derfor gør de det nemt for folk at oprette sig. Desværre betyder det også, at der er meget spam på disse platforme.\n\nHos Feddit.dk er der ingen reklamer, og vi tjener ikke penge på, at der kommer flere brugere. Faktisk bliver det kun sværere at køre siden jo flere brugere der kommer, da det kræver et større moderationsarbejde og øger driftsudgifterne (du er dog meget velkommen til at oprette dig alligevel).\n\n**Derfor prioriterer Feddit.dk en høj *kvalitet* af brugere, fremfor en høj *kvantitet*.** Håbet er, at dette fører til et mere imødekommende miljø og en bedre oplevelse for alle på Feddit.dk.',

Eu consigo cobrir parte dos custos, mas para garantir o seu suave funcionamento, é necessária algum auxílio. Ninguém se deve sentir no dever de doar o que seja, porém àqueles e àquelas que têm a **possibilidade** e a vontade, qualquer ajuda é muito bem-vinda :)\n\nEis a página de LiberaPay onde é possível fazer um donativo: https://liberapay.com/lemmy.pt/  \n*Num futuro próximo vai ser estabelecido um repositório com registos mensais de donativos e despesas, de modo a existir maior transparência no financiamento da instância. Fiquem atentos.*\n\n---\n\n#### Matrix\n\nExiste uma sala na rede Matrix dedicado a esta instância de Lemmy. \nAqui, além de discussões sobre a instância, os administradores vão publicando avisos relativamente a problemas técnicos e interrupções de serviço.\nJunta-te a [`#tuga-lemmy:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#tuga-lemmy:matrix.org) para participares na conversa!\n\nExistem também outras salas portuguesas que podes ver aderindo ao espaço [`#espacotuga:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#espacotuga:matrix.org).\n\nTambém é possível entrar em contacto com os administradores através das mensagens privadas da plataforma, ou [por correio eletrónico](mailto:admin@lemmy.pt).\n\n---\n\n#### Traduzir o Lemmy\n\nSendo apologistas do movimento de *software* livre e da ideia de redes federadas, temos contribuído para o projecto através da tradução para Português. \nEste processo é realizado através da instância de Weblate (uma ferramenta de tradução, também ela livre) do projecto Lemmy, e que pode ser econtrada em https://weblate.join-lemmy.org\nQualquer sugestão de tradução é bem-vinda!\n\nDiscussão sobre a tradução do projecto pode ser feita na sala de Matrix acima referida, ou, alternativamente, numa outra sala sobre tradução em geral, em [`#tuga-traducao:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#tuga-traducao:matrix.org)\n\n---\n\n#### [WebTejo](https://webtejo.pt)\n\nEsta instância corre num servidor da WebTejo, uma empresa de alojamento web independente e nacional.

                "**Privacy Policy**\n\nWe provide this information according to the EU Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) for those who consult the website https://monero.town and request to register. Note that this information applies only to that website and not to other websites the user may consult through links.\n\n**Data controller**\n\nThe data controller is [@admin@monero.town](https://monero.town/u/admin). \n\n**What data is collected.**\n\nRegarding this point, we must distinguish two steps.\n\n(a) Registration in the community: username, password;\n\n(b) Access to the community and user activities: IP address, username, password.\n\nThe user data (username, password) are recorded in the database, and specifically, the passwords are “hashed” (i.e., transformed into alphanumeric strings using the hash function).\n\n**Access to the community and user activities**\n\nHaving completed the account creation process, the user can log in (Login) to the community through the browser, the IP address is acquired.\n\nEach user is responsible for the content they intend to post on the Lemmy community.\n\nIn that phase, the personal data of users collected are the username, password and IP address.\n\n**Who can access the data and for what activities.**\n\nThe server administrator (instance) can read data of the activities performed on the community recorded on the server and precisely in the database or log files (username, IP address, community web address, type of activity - technically GET or POST).\n\nThe administrator only accesses users’ personal data for strictly technical reasons.\n\nWe should point out that access to users’ personal data, whether in the database or logs, is a specific activity that is not generally performed except to resolve particular conflicts or errors.\n\n**The purposes of the processing.**\n\nThe purpose is to consult this website or interact by posting content, comments, or creating other communities. Accessing this website, and requesting to register as a user, means the user gave consent.\n\nFurthermore, the purposes are also related to server maintenance and system and application upgrades.\n\nThe optional, explicit, and voluntary sending of electronic mail to the addresses indicated on this site involves the acquisition of the sender’s address necessary for the replies and any other personal data contained in the message. These data are processed to respond to messages sent and handle related requests. Failure to provide personal data for communications with us or send requests will prevent evading them. We store data for the time strictly necessary for the purposes related to data processing.\n\n**Legal basis for the processing**\n\nThe processing of personal data is based on consent - according to article 6, par. 1, letter a) of EU Regulation 2016/679 - expressed by the user by browsing this website and its consultation, thus accepting this information.\n\nConsent is optional, and the user can withdraw at any time by request sent by email to monerobull@protonmail.com, specifying that, in this case, whether the user does not consent, they cannot consult this website, either register or remain as a registered user.\n\nRegarding server maintenance and system and application upgrades, the legal basis is the legitimate interest according to Article 6, letter f) of the EU Regulation 2016/679.\n\n**Cookies**\n\nThe only cookies are only functional ones and, therefore, no profiling or tracking activities.\n\nThus, this site does not use cookies other than functional cookies solely for the functional purposes described above, and their installation does not require the user’s consent.\n\n**Data recipients**\n\nWe do not communicate personal data collected from this website following its consultation to recipients or categories of recipients.\n\n**Period for storing personal data**\n\nApart from what is specified above, the data collected by this website during its operation are stored for the time strictly necessary for the activities specified. The data will be deleted or anonymized at the expiry date unless there are no other purposes for storing the same.\n\n**Transferring personal data to a third country or international organization**\n\nThe data controller, the administrator of Lemmy’s instance, does not transfer data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) if Lemmy is installed on the server located within the European Economic Area.\n\nWe feel it is appropriate to clarify this further.\n\nUsers registered on an instance are always solely responsible for their activities by creating communities or publishing posts or comments.\n\nThere is no transfer outside the SEE when registered users on an instance within the same EEA perform activities on the same server (instance). For example, our instance (https://monero.house) is located in Germany and thus within the EEA. If users registered on our instance perform activities on our server, there is no data transfer outside the EEA. Similarly, there is no data transfer outside the EEA even if registered users on our instance subscribe, publish posts, or comments on other instances - for example - located outside the EEA. Indeed, in the latter case, our instance administrator can access the logs and see only the domain (and thus not even the full URL of the community on which activities are performed) and its IP address. No further user data is transferred outside the EEA by the administrator or automatically by the Lemmy platform. The user should be aware that their username in the form “@username@domainofcommunity” (e.g., in our case, @username@monero.house) will be visible in the community in which they have intervened (e.g., to publish posts or comments).\n\nThere will be no transfer of data outside the EEA even if the user intends to create a community on the existing Lemmy instance within the same EEA.\n\nAll of this is because it is a proper function of the fediverse’s system and the ActivityPub protocol used by Lemmy.\n\n**Security measures**\n\nVisitors’ or users’ data are processed lawfully and correctly by adopting appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of data. Your data in the communication session with this website are protected by a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate that uses a cryptographic presentation protocol, encrypting the information.\n\n**Data subjects’ rights**\n\nUsers (data subject) of this website may exercise the rights according to Articles 15 to 22 of EU Regulation 2016/679. You can lodge all requests to exercise these rights by writing to monerobull@protonmail.com\n\n**Right to lodge a complaint**\n\nWhether a data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to them as performed via this website infringes the Regulation, they have the right to lodge a complaint with the Garante according to Article 77 of the EU Regulation 2016/679.\n",

Behaviour and Etiquette\n\n- Be Respectful. Do not bully, flame, or harass others.\n- Malicious comments are not allowed but heated discussion and salty banter is okay.\n- Low effort replies and complaints about content will be removed.\n- No bigotry of any kind.\n- No pornography.\n\n2. Content Guidelines\n\n- [!wetshaving@sub.wetshaving.social](https://sub.wetshaving.social/c/wetshaving) is the main subLemmy, which will have the Mail Call, Simple Questions, and SOTD threads. \n- [!shave_bazaar@sub.wetshaving.social](https://sub.wetshaving.social/c/shave_bazaar) is the primary subLemmy for buy/sell/trade.\n- Users are welcome to form other subLemmys on this server so long as they are related to traditional wet shaving. Administrators reserve the right to remove subLemmys that are not related to traditional wet shaving.\n\n3. Reviews and Disclosure\n\n- Use [First Impressions] if your experience with the product is limited.\n- Use [Review] if you can provide comprehensive details with enough familiarity to answer follow-up questions.\n- Disclose how the product being reviewed was acquired (e.g., PIF, loan, or purchase). If the product was provided to you directly by the maker or vendor free of charge or at a discount, you must disclose this fact even if the item will later be returned to the maker or vendor.\n\n4. Advertising\n- Vendors are to keep marketing within the biweekly Deals/New Products threads or on [!shave_bazaar@sub.wetshaving.social](https://sub.wetshaving.social/c/shave_bazaar)\n- Non-vendors may post topics about products if it will foster a compelling discussion.\n\n5. Inappropriate Content\n\n- All NSFW/L content must request administrator approval and be flaired appropriately.\n- Non-shaving related NSFW/L content is not allowed.\n\n∞. Administrator Discretion\n\n- The rules may not apply perfectly to every situation. The administrators have final discretion.\n- Questions, concerns, or appeals must be sent to [@wetshavingadmin@sub.wetshaving.social](https://sub.wetshaving.social/u/wetshavingadmin). Do not message individual administrators.",

Anyone wishing to contribute to that goal is welcome!\n\nWe aren't there yet in terms of user count, but once we get enough users for it to be worthwhile, I plan to set up some kind of donation system (most likely Librepay) to help offset hosting costs. Depending on the level of donations, registration may be closed to keep the server load reasonable within the funding allotted. As soon as I start accepting other people's money, I will start publishing a monthly financial report for the server.\n\n**Rules:**\n* Don't be a dick\n* Be respectful of others\n* When commenting/posting on other instances, follow their rules\n* No porn.

                "Hello, neighbor! Welcome to Tucson.social! Tucson is where the heart of the Sonoran Desert harmoniously blends with urban charm. Sky Islands majestically rise from the vast desert floor and diverse wildlife adds a layer of enchantment to our city. From bobcats and roadrunners to the occasional rattlesnake and elusive Gila Monster, we've got an amazing cast. Our local javelinas and coyotes, while not the cuddly types, paint a genuine picture of desert life. And if you're looking to see adorable fluffy rodents play in the dirt, the round-tailed ground squirrels won't disappoint!\n\nTucson is also proud to host the University of Arizona - Go Wildcats! Our city thrives with a culture of innovation, vibrant student life, and a community spirit that warms every corner. Downtown and midtown offer an abundance of modern comforts and unique activities that promise endless discovery.\n\nSteeped in a rich history, Tucson is a treasure trove of heritage sites. The historic Mission San Xavier del Bac stands as a testament to our community's longstanding faith, while places like the Presidio San Agustín del Tucson and El Tiradito carry stories from centuries past. A short drive away, the Del-Bac Distillery captures Tucson's vivacious spirit in each bottle of finely crafted whiskey.\n\nBut the true magic of Tucson reveals itself when the sun goes down.

                '# This page contains the following documents:\n - Code of Conduct,\n - Privacy policy,\n - Media attribution.\n\n ---\n # Code of Conduct\n ---\n This Code contains the rules and principles for participating in the Laguna.chat community. It is intended to protect all members of our community from harassment and to ensure that our community is as welcoming and inclusive as possible. Due to the nature of Lemmy and the fediverse we can\'t moderate other instances. But we will block other instances that cause harassment.\n This is a working document, so the Laguna.chat team may amend it from time to time.\n\n ## Goals\n - Provide a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone regardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, political affiliation, or other similar characteristic.\n - Create a supportive community, where people freely share their passions and are excited and positive about each other’s successes.                     --\n - Protect our community from harassment, malicious or illegal content and from individual members whose goals are to disrupt our community and promote their own self-interest at the expense of the community.\n\n ## Principles that guide us\n - **We are not a free speech zone.** This CoC lays out expected standards of conduct and behavior. You cannot say or post anything that violates these rules or principles and remain a member of our community. You must follow this CoC. If you are looking for something else, please do. It is not here.\n - **The Moderators are not morality or thought police.** Moderators are guided by this Code of Conduct. Post what you want, if what you post follows these rules, principles and the goals outlined above. Not every member of the community will appreciate controversial or explicit posts so use Content Warnings very liberally. We use Content Warnings so community members themselves can decide whether they want to see or engage with a post that may be controversial or explicit.\n - **Bullies, trolls and disruptors are not welcome in Laguna.chat.** We will moderate accordingly.\n - **This is a voluntary community. You chose to be here.** When you choose to join, you have implied that you agree with this Code of Conduct and will follow it.\n\n ## Rules for posting\n The rules you need to follow if you want to be a member of our community are stated below.\n\n ## General guidance on posting and participating in Laguna.chat\n - **Do not post about inflammatory, controversial subjects without a Content Warning.** Ideally, you would not post about inflammatory subjects at all. However, it may be acceptable to do so in some cases, but it is never acceptable to post inflammatory content without hiding the content behind an appropriate Content Warning.\n - **Do not post any type of nudity without a Content Warning.**\n - **Regarding Spam: We are not your free advertising platform.** If you are here only to sell your products or services, you will be removed. Occasional posts of commercial links are OK, but when the vast majority of a user\'s posts are commercial in nature, we regard the account as a Spam account. Moderators will evaluate reports of Spam on a case by case basis.\n - **Do not engage in name calling, [ad hominem attacks](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ad%20hominem),** or any other uncivil behaviour. Criticize ideas, never people.\n - **Do not report every post that upsets you.** Please report posts that violate our rules but for others that you may find distasteful, or just don’t like, use the tools available to you. You can block the user or mute the conversation.\n\n ## Moderation Principles\n Reported content will be assessed on a balance of probabilities by the moderators. In other words, whether it is more likely than not that the content violates one or more of these rules. Moderators will suspend an account from Laguna.chat when the user demonstrates that they have breached any rule several times, or if their content (including profile description) suggests that they are likely to continue to break the rules. The number of breaches leading to suspension is deliberately not defined. In egregious cases, one breach can result in suspension of the user account.\n\n Secret application questionnaire answer: Boogiewoogie912\n\n The moderation team takes a pragmatic approach to every report they receive - if they feel that a problematic post isn’t explicitly a breach of any of these rules but is inappropriate for Laguna.chat, the post will likely be removed. Users who repeatedly post problematic content or otherwise are seen by the moderators as a negative, disruptive presence in our community can be removed at the discretion of the moderation team, even if those posts or the user did not explicitly violate our rules.\n\n ---\n # Privacy policy\n ---\n This privacy policy describes how Laguna.chat ("Laguna.chat", "we", "us") collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information you may provide through the Laguna.chat website or its API. The policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This policy also describes how your engagement (profile information, posts, comments, direct messages, votes) is distributed and accessed. Thiai levelss policy does not apply to the practices of companies or organizations that Laguna.chat does not own or control, or to individuals that Laguna.chat does not employ or manage.\n\n By joining this service you are engaging in, and contributing to, the very exciting and emerging space of free open communication on the internet. **HOWEVER YOU ARE JOINING WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS SERVICE IS RUNNING ON VERY EARLY RELEASE SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ENTIRELY EXPERIMENTAL. ALTHOUGH ALL REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA, WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE OR THIS INSTANCE CONFIGURATION IS FREE FROM DEFECT THAT MAY RESULT IN THE EXPOSURE OF ANY OR ALL SUBMITTED DATA.**\n\n **You also understand that although there are controls to prevent the distribution of your email and IP address, due to the nature of federated services, all of your engagement on this platform should be considered public. We feel that proper precautions should be taken by the user regardless of what services they choose to use to engage in internet discourse, but it is highly recommended that you do not share any information on Laguna.chat, or the Lemmy platform, that could in any way personally identify you.**\n\n\n ## What information do we collect?\n\n * **Basic account information**: If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an email address and a password. You may also enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture. The username, display name, biography, profile picture are always listed publicly.\n * **Posts, comments, subscribing, voting, and other public information**: Communities you subscribe to may be disclosed to the admins of remote instances. Although user vote records are not accessible through the UI, this should also be considered public, and there are conditions which result in it becoming publicly viewable. When you post, the date and time is stored as well as the application you posted from. Posts and comments may contain media attachments, such as pictures and videos. Posts and comments are available publicly. Anything displayed on your profile is also publicly available information. Your comment history is available publicly. Your posts are delivered to the communities they are posted on, in some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. When you delete posts, this is likewise broadcast to other instances, however there is no guarantee that the removal request will be respected, or even broadcast to all instances. There are conditions that may result in copies of your profile, posts, comments, voting record not being removed or editable when requesting so from your local instance. This service interoperates with other federated services such as Mastodon; the format, interpretation, and display of your engagement may function differently than it does on Lemmy. \\\n  \\\n **In essence, your IP address and email remain private to this local instance, however due to the nature of federated services all engagement should be considered public and you are responsible for taking appropriate precautions in how you engage. Do not share any sensitive or information you do not want public over Lemmy.**\n\n * **Direct messages**: All messages are stored and processed on the instance. In some cases it means they are delivered to different instances and copies are stored there. We make a good faith effort to limit the access to these direct messages to only authorized persons, but other instances may fail to do so. Therefore it\'s important to review the instances of users you are engaging with. **Please keep in mind that the operators of the instance and any receiving instance may view such messages**, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. **Do not share any sensitive information over Lemmy.**\n * **IPs and other metadata**: When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. The latest IP address used is stored for up to 12 months. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.\n\n * **User agent and country**: We use a self hosted, privacy focused, web analytics solution called [Umami](https://github.com/umami-software/umami). This analytics suite is used to understand our userbase and adjust to their cultural needs. We respect the "Do not track" option of your browser, if you are ubable to use the "Do not track" option you can always block "https://analytics.Laguna.chat/Laguna.js" using an adblocker.\n\n ## What do we use your information for?\n Any of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n * To provide the core functionality of Lemmy. You can only engage with other people\'s content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may subscribe to other communities for content discovery.\n * To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.\n * The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.\n\n ## How do we protect your information?\n We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm.\n\n Maintenance access to the servers that keep this instance online can only be accessed from a private VPN network.\n\n Our servers are being actively monitored for malware and other threats. Thus limiting the posibility of unforseen attacks on our infrastructure and your privacy.\n\n We hosts our own email server. Which allows us to take full control over our email flow. Its data is encrypted and our email users can only be accessed using SSL/TLS or STARTTLS. You can also use our public PGP keys to verify emails from Support@Laguna.chat ([https://laguna.chat/support.asc](https://laguna.chat/support.asc)) and Security@Laguna.chat ([https://laguna.chat/security.asc](https://laguna.chat/security.asc)).\n\n ## What is our data retention policy?\n We will make a good faith effort to:\n * Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server, in so far as such logs are kept, no more than 90 days.\n * Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users no more than 12 months.\n\n You may irreversibly delete your account at any time. **However, this does not guarantee all instances will be notified or respect the deletion of your public data.**\n\n Our backup retention policy is to keep backups for a maximum of 6 months. These backups may contain your account data till the expiration of the backup that contains your data.\n\n ## Do we use cookies?\n Yes, but only to keep your account logged in. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer\'s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.\n We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits. We do not use tracking cookies!\n\n ## Do we disclose any information to outside parties?\n We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.\n\n Our third parties are:\n - **Contabo**: Hosts our servers, is able to access our servers in case of platform violations,\n - **Cloudflare**: Protects the server against DDOS attacks,\n - **NCMEC**: Regularly checks our content for child sexual abuse material,\n - **Other Lemmy instances**: When you post, send a comment or subscribe to other instance we cannot protect your data! Make sure that these instances protect your privacy adequately.\n\n Your public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your public and community posts are delivered to the servers where the community resides, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the recipients, in so far as those communities or recipients reside on a different server than this.\n\n When you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you approve, it may access your public profile information, your subscription list, all your posts, and your voting history.

                'This privacy policy describes how Servarr ("Servarr", "we", "us") collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information you may provide through the Servarr website or its API. The policy also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. This policy also describes how your engagement (profile information, posts, comments, direct messages, votes) is distributed and accessed. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or organizations that Servarr does not own or control, or to individuals that Servarr does not employ or manage.\n\nBy joining this service you are engaging in, and contributing to, the very exciting and emerging space of free open communication on the internet. **HOWEVER YOU ARE JOINING WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS SERVICE IS RUNNING ON VERY EARLY RELEASE SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ENTIRELY EXPERIMENTAL. ALTHOUGH ALL REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA, WE CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE OR THIS INSTANCE CONFIGURATION IS FREE FROM DEFECT THAT MAY RESULT IN THE EXPOSURE OF ANY OR ALL SUBMITTED DATA.**\n\n**You also understand that although there are controls to prevent the distribution of your email and IP address, due to the nature of federated services, all of your engagement on this platform should be considered public. We feel that proper precautions should be taken by the user regardless of what services they choose to use to engage in internet discourse, but it is highly recommended that you do not share any information on Servarr, or the Lemmy platform, that could in any way personally identify you.**\n\n\n# **What information do we collect?**\n\n\n\n* **Basic account information**: If you register on this server, you may be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password. You may also enter additional profile information such as a display name and biography, and upload a profile picture. The username, display name, biography, profile picture are always listed publicly.\n* **Posts, comments, subscribing, voting, and other public information**: Communities you subscribe to may be disclosed to the admins of remote instances. Although user vote records are not accessible through the UI, this should also be considered public, and there are conditions which result in it becoming publicly viewable. When you post, the date and time is stored as well as the application you posted from. Posts and comments may contain media attachments, such as pictures and videos. Posts and comments are available publicly. Anything displayed on your profile is also publicly available information. Your comment history is available publicly. Your posts are delivered to the communities they are posted on, in some cases it means they are delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. When you delete posts, this is likewise broadcast to other instances, however there is no guarantee that the removal request will be respected, or even broadcast to all instances. There are conditions that may result in copies of your profile, posts, comments, voting record not being removed or editable when requesting so from your local instance. This service interoperates with other federated services such as Mastodon; the format, interpretation, and display of your engagement may function differently than it does on Lemmy. \\\n \\\n**In essence, your IP address and email remain private to this local instance, however due to the nature of federated services all engagement should be considered public and you are responsible for taking appropriate precautions in how you engage. Do not share any sensitive or information you do not want public over Lemmy.** \n  \n* **Direct messages**: All messages are stored and processed on the instance. In some cases it means they are delivered to different instances and copies are stored there. We make a good faith effort to limit the access to these direct messages to only authorized persons, but other instances may fail to do so. Therefore it\'s important to review the instances of users you are engaging with. **Please keep in mind that the operators of the instance and any receiving instance may view such messages**, and that recipients may screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. **Do not share any sensitive information over Lemmy.**\n\n* **IPs and other metadata**: When you log in, we record the IP address you log in from, as well as the name of your browser application. The latest IP address used is stored for up to 12 months. We also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to our server.\n\n\n# **What do we use your information for?**\n\nAny of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:\n\n\n\n* To provide the core functionality of Lemmy. You can only engage with other people\'s content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may subscribe to other communities for content discovery.\n* To aid moderation of the community, for example comparing your IP address with other known ones to determine ban evasion or other violations.\n* The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.\n\n\n# **How do we protect your information?**\n\nWe implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. \n\nWe are disclosing that Lemmy currently does not support SSL for PostgreSQL. This instance has mitigated this security risk by running the PostgreSQL service on the same host as the instance backend, and has blocked all incoming and outgoing network connections to the PostgreSQL service.\n\n\n# **What is our data retention policy?**\n\nWe will make a good faith effort to:\n\n\n\n* Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server, in so far as such logs are kept, no more than 90 days.\n* Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users no more than 12 months.\n\nYou may irreversibly delete your account at any time. **However, this does not guarantee all instances will be notified or respect the deletion of your public data.**\n\n\n# **Do we use cookies?**\n\nYes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer\'s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow). These cookies enable the site to recognize your browser and, if you have a registered account, associate it with your registered account.\n\nWe use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits.\n\n\n# **Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**\n\nWe do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.\n\nYour public content may be downloaded by other servers in the network. Your public and community posts are delivered to the servers where the community resides, and direct messages are delivered to the servers of the recipients, in so far as those communities or recipients reside on a different server than this.\n\nWhen you authorize an application to use your account, depending on the scope of permissions you approve, it may access your public profile information, your subscription list, all your posts, and your voting history. Applications can never access your e-mail address or password from the API, however it may be required to give access to your account (ie. logging in).\n\n\n# **Site usage by children**\n\nIf this server is in the EU or the EEA: Our site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 16 years old. If you are under the age of 16, per the requirements of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) do not use this site.\n\nIf this server is in the USA: Our site, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old. If you are under the age of 13, per the requirements of COPPA (Children\'s Online Privacy Protection Act) do not use this site.\n\nLaw requirements can be different if this server is in another jurisdiction.\n\n\n---\n\nThis document is CC-BY-SA.

Where before discussion boards around artists like Miley Cyrus, Taylor Swift, Carly Rae Jepsen have always either devolved into mud slinging or NSFW/picture spam, this Lemmy instance aims to be a safe place to instead come, chat about your favorite artists, get excited for upcoming events, post all of your favorite clowning, and have a good time.\n\nThe server is run and hosted by myself, @scrubbles, and you can feel free to @ me anytime here.  I aim to keep it free and open to anyone while also making it a fun space without hate or trolls.  \n\nI personally maintain this instance for others to use, it is of course completely free to subscribe and federate with.  However, if you feel like helping me out with maintenance costs, I'll never say no to someone [buying me a coffee](https://bmc.link/scrubbles).\n\nThis instance is fully federated, so you are welcome to add to other instances!\n\nOther communities we recommend\n- [IndieHeads](https://lemmy.ml/c/indieheads)\n- [Music@beehaw.org](https://beehaw.org/c/music)\n- [HipHopHeads@sopuli.xyz](https://sopuli.xyz/c/hiphopheads)\n- [gratefuldead@lemmy.world](https://lemmy.world/c/gratefuldead)",
